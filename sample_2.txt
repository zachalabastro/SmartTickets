Hello GCash Support,

I've encountered an issue where payments made through GPay's 
QR feature are not going through. Multiple attempts at different 
merchants result in a 'Payment Failed' message, despite having 
sufficient balance. This started two days ago, and I need to use the 
QR payment feature for daily transactions.

Please look into this promptly, as it's impacting my ability to make purchases.
