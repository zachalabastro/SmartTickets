GHIVIC TAAL
Dear GCash Support,

I am writing to report a discrepancy in my GSave account balance.

As of my last check, the balance reflected in my GSave account does not correspond with the transactions I've recorded.
There appears to be a deposit that I executed via linked bank transfer which is not showing up in my account history,
although my external bank account has been debited. This issue has caused me considerable concern as it affects the
accuracy of my financial records and my trust in the platform.

This transaction was dated five days ago, and I expected it to be visible in my account within 24 hours,

as per the usual processing time. I've verified the transaction details multiple times and ensured that there
was no error on the initiating end. I urgently require clarification and rectification of this issue, as it is
paramount for me to have an accurate and reliable record of my savings.

Please prioritize the investigation of this reconciliation error and provide me with an update at the earliest
convenience. If additional information is needed to facilitate the resolution of this matter, feel free to reach out.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this urgent matter.
