"Instacash PaymentGreetings, Sprout Support
I am writing to notify you of a delay in the processing of my most recent InstaCash loan repayment, which I started with a P5,000 repayment through the Sprout mobile app.
Repayment requests for InstaCash loans are normally processed within three to five business days. However, the amount has not been deducted from my bank account and it has been ten days since I made the request.
I discovered that the repayment status is still listed as ""Processing"" after looking through my transaction history on the app.
I am eager to avoid any additional charges, and I am concerned about this delay, especially in light of the possible accrual of interest on outstanding loans.
Would you kindly look into the cause of my InstaCash loan's prolonged processing time? If you could speed up the procedure and let me know when the repayment will appear in my account, that would be greatly appreciated.
We appreciate your quick response and help with this.
Sincerely,
George",Problem,Normal,InstaCash: Payments,Sprout Instacash
"Re: BIOMETRIC LOGS NOT REFLECTINGDear Sprout Support,
I am reaching out to inquire about a potential issue I have observed with the biometric logs in Sprout HR.
Recently, I have noticed that some employee biometric attendance punches are not being accurately reflected in the system. While this does not completely prevent us from tracking attendance, it has created minor inconsistencies.
I would appreciate if you could investigate this matter and provide guidance on the following:
Are there any known issues with the integration of biometric logs in Sprout HR?
What troubleshooting steps can be taken to ensure the accurate recording of employee biometric logs?
Is there a way to manually add any missing logs if necessary?
Thank you for your time and assistance in addressing this concern.",Question,Low,Biologs,Sprout HR
