First, could you please provide us with detailed instructions on how to initiate the SSO migration within our Sprout HR platform? Additionally, are there any specific requirements or preparations that we need to complete before starting the migration process?

Finally, I would like to verify what support will be available from your team during the migration in case we encounter any technical difficulties or require assistance.

"Sprout Payroll InquiryGreetings, Sprout Support
We are now considering Sprout Payroll as a possible option to take care of our payroll and HR requirements. We're a 20-person small business looking for ways to automate and expedite the payroll process.
The integration of Sprout Payroll with Time Clock Plus, our current timekeeping system, is one of our main concerns. Since manually entering employee hours can be laborious and error-prone, we are interested in learning more about the integration possibilities.
We would be grateful if you could respond to the following inquiries about the integration capabilities of Sprout Payroll:
Does Time Clock Plus offer direct integration with Sprout Payroll?
If not, is it possible to manually upload Time Clock Plus employee hour data?
What information, such as employee hours, overtime, and leave balances, can be automatically synchronized between the two systems, assuming integration is feasible?
Our business operations depend on the smooth integration of our payroll and timekeeping systems. We are eager to find out more about the capabilities of Sprout Payroll in this regard.
I appreciate your help and time.
